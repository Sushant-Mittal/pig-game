Two player dice game. Was a part of Javascript course by Jonas Schmettdman.

## Rules of playing:

1) Players take turns to roll a random 6 faced dice.
2) Players add the current face of dice to their temporary accumulated score.
3) If the dice face shows 1, current player loses the accumulated score and the turn is shifted to the second player.
4) Players can however choose to hold the accumulated score and add this to their permanent score. Doing this will shift the turn to the other player.
5) First player to reach a score of 100 wins the game.
